Overview: In this assignment, you will create a Java program to calculate and display the average grades of students in a class. 
You will use classes, loops, and functions to accomplish this task. 
You can use the homework you have done previously. 

Instructions: 

1)Create a Java program with the following specifications: 
1.1)Define a class named Student with the following attributes: 
 - name (String): The name of the student.
  - grades (array of integers): An array to store the student's grades for different subjects. You can assume a fixed number of subjects (e.g., 5).
1.2)Implement the following methods within the Student class:
  - getAverageGrade(): A function that calculates and returns the average grade of the student.
2)In the main method of your program, create an array of Student objects to represent a class of students. You can decide the number of students in the class (e.g., 5).
3)Use a loop to input the following information for each student:
  - Student's name.
  - Student's grades for each subject.
4)Display the following information for each student:
 - Student's name.
 - Student's average grade.
5)After processing all students, calculate and display the class's average grade.
6)Output could look like below and could be a toString function in your class.

Student 1: 
Name: John Doe 
Grades: 85 90 78 92 88 
Average Grade: 86.6 

Student 2: 
Name: Jane Smith 
Grades: 75 88 92 79 87 
Average Grade: 84.2 

Student 3: 
Name: Alice Johson 
Grades: 92 94 89 85 90 
Average Grade: 90.0 

Student 4: 
Name: Bob Anderson 
Grades: 78 80 82 76 85 
Average Grade: 80.2 

Student 5: 
Name: Emily Brown 
Grades: 88 95 91 87 79 
Average Grade: 90.0 

Create a JUnit Test Script: StudentTest.java This JUnit test script contains test cases to validate the functionality of the Student class's methods. 
In addation the script will contains several test cases that evaluate the getAverageGrade method under different scenarios, 
including cases with valid and empty grades arrays.
